Alan White ("we," "us," or "our") operates DrumScore Editor ("the Software"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect information when you use the Software.

## 1. Information We Collect

### 1.1 Information Stored Locally

The Software stores the following information **locally on your device only**:

- **User Preferences:** Application settings, theme choices, language preferences, display options
- **License Information:** Your license key (encrypted), licensee name, and email address
- **Musical Scores:** All compositions and arrangements you create
- **Recent Files:** Paths to recently opened files
- **Window Positions:** Size and position of application windows

**This data never leaves your computer** unless you explicitly choose to share files or enable optional features described below.

### 1.2 Anonymous Usage Analytics (Optional)

Starting with version [3.5], the Software includes optional anonymous usage analytics. When enabled, we collect:

**What we collect:**
- Features used and frequency of use
- Software version and operating system
- Session duration
- Crash reports and error logs
- General workflow patterns (e.g., "user created volta," "user exported to PDF")

**What we do NOT collect:**
- Your name, email, or license information
- Musical compositions or score content
- File names, paths, or any file metadata
- IP addresses or device identifiers
- Any personally identifiable information

**Anonymous Identifier:** We generate a random anonymous ID (UUID) stored locally to help us understand usage patterns without identifying you personally.

**Opt-Out:** You may disable analytics at any time in Preferences → Privacy. This setting is respected immediately.

### 1.3 Update Checking (Optional)

The Software can periodically check for available updates. When enabled, update checks transmit:

- Current Software version
- Operating system type and version

**No personally identifiable information is transmitted during update checks.**

**Opt-Out:** You may disable automatic update checking in Preferences → Updates.

## 3. Data Storage and Security

### 3.1 Local Storage
Your preferences, scores, and license information are stored using Java Preferences API and file system storage on your computer. License keys are encrypted using industry-standard encryption (PBEWithMD5AndDES).

### 3.2 Analytics Data
If you enable analytics, anonymous data is transmitted over HTTPS to our secure server and stored for analysis. This data cannot be linked back to you personally.

### 3.3 No Cloud Storage
We do not store your musical compositions or personal data on any cloud service. Your work remains on your device unless you choose to export or share it.

---

## 4. Data Sharing and Third Parties

### 4.1 No Sale of Data
We do not sell, rent, or trade any information collected by the Software.

### 4.2 Third-Party Services
The Software does not integrate with third-party analytics services, advertising networks, or data brokers.

### 4.3 Legal Requirements
We may disclose information if required by law, court order, or to protect our legal rights. However, since we collect minimal data and most is stored locally, there is very little we could disclose.

---

## 5. Your Rights and Choices

### 5.1 Access Your Data
All your data is stored locally on your device. You have complete access to:
- Your musical scores (in your file system)
- Your preferences (via Preferences menu)
- Your license information (via License dialog)

### 5.2 Delete Your Data
You may delete any or all data at any time:
- **Scores:** Delete files from your file system
- **Preferences:** Reset to defaults in Preferences menu
- **License:** Remove license using command: `DrumScoreEditor removeLicense`
- **Analytics:** Disable in Preferences (no past data can be linked to you anyway)

### 5.3 Opt-Out of Analytics and Updates
Both anonymous analytics and update checking are **opt-out**:
1. Open Preferences → Privacy
2. Uncheck "Send anonymous usage statistics"
3. Uncheck "Automatically check for updates"

Changes take effect immediately.

## 6. Children's Privacy

The Software is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children. If we learn we have collected information from a child under 13, we will delete it promptly.
