## Documentation Style Guide

### Writing Style

- **Clear and concise**: Use simple language
- **Action-oriented**: "Click the Add button" not "The Add button can be clicked"
- **Consistent terminology**: Use DSE's UI terms exactly as they appear
- **Beginner-friendly**: Don't assume advanced music notation knowledge

### Formatting

- Use Markdown formatting
- Headers: Use `#`, `##`, `###` hierarchy
- Code/UI elements: Use `backticks` for button names, menu items, keyboard shortcuts
- Lists: Use `-` for unordered lists, `1.` for ordered lists
- Images: Store in `/images` folder, reference with relative paths

### Screenshots

- Use English version of DSE for English docs (localized versions for translations)
- Crop to show only relevant UI areas
- Use PNG format
- Name descriptively: `creating-new-score.png`
- Keep file sizes reasonable (< 500KB if possible)

## Translation Guidelines

### Starting a New Language

1. **Check if translation is needed**: Open an issue to discuss
2. **Create language folder**: Use ISO 639-1 code (e.g., `es/` for Spanish)
3. **Copy English structure**: Maintain same file/folder organization
4. **Translate content**: Adapt examples for cultural context where appropriate
5. **Update main README**: Add your language to the list

### Translation Tips

- Translate naturally, don't be overly literal
- Keep UI element names as they appear in DSE's localized version
- Musical terms: Use standard terms in your language
- When in doubt, ask in your PR or open an issue
